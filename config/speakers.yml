    title: "Autonomous Control of a Deep Space Power System"
    bio: >-
      Autonomy is required for manned spacecraft missions distant enough
      that light-time communication delays make ground-based mission control
      infeasible. Presently, ground controllers develop a complete schedule of
      power modes for all spacecraft components based on a large number of
      factors and then remotely execute those commands on the vehicle.
      Contrast this with a mission to Demos and/or Phobos or a mission to the
      planet Mars that involves a total travel time of 6 to 9 months, and
      communication delays that can vary anywhere from 6 to 44 minutes
      roundtrip. Because the communication delays are so long, the mission
      control center on Earth will no longer have the ability to assist the
      astronauts in real-time to diagnose and correct problems with the
      spacecraft. In addition, it is expected that the astronauts that will
      undertake such missions will not be domain experts in the respective
      subsystems required to operate the spacecraft. Consequently, each of the
      subsystems will have to have built into it a substantial amount of
      intelligence to permit its routine operation as well as fault diagnosis
      and corrective actions. This talk will discuss the use of a Multi-Agent
      System for the control of a spacecraft's electric power system to enable
      modular and responsive autonomy. Parallels between the space-based power
      system and the terrestrial power grid will be discussed and some
      in-progress examples of this type of control will be shown.

       decentralized control systems, control of electric power systems,
       autonomous systems, and nonlinear optimization. Ryan is currently
       pursuing his PhD at Case Western Reserve University.

    title: "The Situation of Context"
    bio: >-
      Word embeddings aim to capture the semantic representation of words in
      vector space, and have been successfully used to enrich existing language
      models and improve accuracy in some fundamental tasks in natural language
      processing. Popular tools for creating word embeddings examine a word’s
      surrounding context of neighboring words to create a vector
      representation for that word. This approach however, does not account for
      possibly relevant context information for a target word that exists far
      outside of the immediate window of neighboring words.  In this talk we
      will explore using a more syntactically motivated context window to build
      word vectors with an aim to increase the accuracy of downstream syntactic
      NLP tasks.

       Ethan Hill is a software engineer at IBM Watson Health (formerly
       Explorys) in Cleveland working on a health care analytics engine. After
       graduating from Ohio State University in 2015 with dual bachelors
       degrees in computer science and German, he joined the IBM Watson group

    bio: >
      Lynn has traveled a long and winding road in her career journey, meeting
      many interesting and famous people along the way… Actress Linda Blair of
      the Exorcist movies, singers and celebrities like Eddie Money, Metallica,
      The Goo Goo Dolls, and Jeff Dunham, just to name a few. And you know what?
      They all put their pants on just like we do! But one thing that they have
      learned to do differently (or have paid to have done differently) is the
      way they brand themselves!

       Personal branding is a necessity in this job market and in the world we
       live in. Branding yourself is vital to getting a job and is not always
       something that comes second nature to everyone. What kinds of content
       marketing tools can you use to BRAND YOU? What do hiring managers look
       for? What is important in a portfolio? Let's find out!

        Currently, Lynn is a Global Marketing Communications Representative for
        Rockwell Automation with 18 years’ experience in the fields of marketing
        (B2B and B2C), advertising, technical blogging, entertainment writing,

    title: Why do neural networks work so well?
    bio: >
      Neural networks are perhaps the most commonly-used commercial machine
      learning algorithm. "Deep learning", which is another way of saying
      "neural networks with a particular shape", has advanced the state of the
      art in speech recognition, image recognition, machine translation, winning
      at Go, and a surprising number of other fields. But unlike "good
      old-fashioned AI" algorithms, which are usually hand-customized, fully
      analyzed analytically, and understood by at least someone, almost all
      neural networks used in practice are understood heuristically (at best).
      Why is that? And given that, why do they work so well? For that matter,
      why do they work at all? Talk begins with a brief introduction to neural
      networks so that everyone can understand why these questions are
      interesting, before we work on answering them.

       Nathan McKinley graduated from CWRU in 2013. His M.S. work was in natural
       language processing, and he currently works in the research and machine
       intelligence division at Google. He has returned to CWRU several times to
       give talks on various AI-related topics, and this is his first time

      Very high efficiency power converters have been essential equipment in the
      server and telecom markets for decades.  More recently, electric vehicle
      chargers have been getting a lot of attention from academic research.  Why
      hasn't the embedded market kept pace?

       This presentation will focus on unique challenges in designing efficient
       power converters for embedded products.  We'll look at the embedded power
       market from a high level and compare it to others.  Additionally, we'll
       look at some low-level, technical ideas to lower the power losses in
       embedded designs.

        Tim graduated from Case in 2008 with a BS in Electrical Engineering.
        Afterward, he move to Austin, TX to work at National Instruments on the

    title: 'Attacking the Monolith'

    bio: >
      Software that is designed in a hurry (also known as all software) tends to
      coalesce into a gigantic ball of mud. Design decisions that once seemed
      prudent are hammered into all sorts of odd shapes to allow for extra
      features to be added or bugs to be fixed. This is not strictly a bad
      thing; most of the software in the world is supposed to create value, not
      just sit there and be pretty. However, going too far in one direction can
      drag development to a halt.

       I've spent the last two years of my working life building tools and
       defining processes that allow developers to tread the fine line between
       too-ugly and just-ugly-enough. Some of my ideas have worked and some have
       not. I'd like to share the lessons I've learned with you.

       Brian is a 2013 graduate of CWRU who just moved back to the region after
       living and working for two years in San Francisco. He worked primarily on
       building tools for developers such as distributed test running systems
       that cut test runtimes from tens of hours to minutes.

      Lynn's love for all things technical and her goal of never putting all of
      her career eggs in one basket has led her down a winding road with stops
      along the way that include CAD design, technical writing, teaching
      computer programing, and now, marketing industrial automation products.
      What else is a non-engineer type to do but race toward promoting STEM
      education and technical careers? Let's face it, working for free never
      ends and can pay you back in a way that you never thought possible! How
      can you use those "eggs" to brand yourself for a future job?

       A full-time Global Marketing Communicator at Rockwell Automation, Lynn
       also moonlights as an Academic Relations Representative for local
       colleges and an online newsletter editor for the Northeast Ohio Society
       for TEchnical Communicators. She is also a member of the Cleveland
       Professional Women's Group team at Rockwell, but her favorite stop has to
       be her STEM initiatives participation with events like Girls Go Science,
       Engineers Week and Manufacturing Day, and the value received from helping
       young people develop a love like hers - for all things technical!

    bio: >
      Most mechanical engineers accept that they have to build their systems
      with off the shelf components. Some understand the principles of the 507
      Mechanical Movements well enough to create their own components. Few
      believe they can create an important new type of mechanism.

       The Cyclone Drive is an important new type of mechanism for mobile
       products that need to produce powerful linear motion. It is a compact
       adaptation of the Chinese Windlass.

       The more important story behind the Cyclone Drive is how it came to be.
       It is a story of desire, intention, obsession, team work, and fun. The
       purpose of this talk is to encourage engineers to be bold and gather
       believers in pursuit of big dreams.

      You’ve studied hard. You know how to code. What’s next? Technology is a
      wide and deep industry with a variety of career paths to choose from. What
      is it like in the real world? What can you expect working in IT? On a
      project, more often than not, the questions clients and managers ask
      technical folks isn’t “how”, but “when”. Project challenges are often not
      a question of innovation but rather, with process and collaboration. The
      Agile methodology helps answer the questions; "When will it be done?",
      “What should we work on next?" and "How hard is it?” Learn strategies for
      breaking down large requirements into sizable units of work, how to track
      progress, manage changes in scope, and work on the most valuable thing.
      Come learn the basics of Agile development process, a technical
      professional’s best friend to delivering valuable, working software.

       Charlotte is a nerd, dog lover and enthusiast who has 10+ years
       experience in IT, in the US and abroad! Charlotte's previous tech
       adventures span across industries, technology platforms, and
       responsibilities - including UX, BA, QA and IM. Presently, she's a
       passionate web developer with discerning sense for user-centered design
       practices at LeanDog. Whatever her role, Charlotte advocates for healthy

      Today's data wireless data transmission emphasis is largely on
      wide-bandwidth, high-speed links on UHF/SHF bands. HF (shortwave) is
      different: The conflicting constraints of long distances, noisy channels,
      narrow-bandwidth and low power budgets require quite different techniques
      for succesful communications on HF. We will discuss history and
      contemporary use and state of development on amateur radio bands.
      Discussion will include minimum-bandwidth phase-shift systems; error
      correction systems; automatic link establishment; amateur radio email; and
      methods for low speed signalling in extremely poor signal-to-noise ratio
      environments.

        Treating cancer using radiation is a technology that is over a century

        dates back to 1953.  However, there has been an explosion in the types
        and complexity of radiation treatment over the past two decades, and
        it's not largely a story of improved accelerator hardware.  Rather, much
        like the Apollo landings were enabled by then-recent advances in
        computer technology, radiation oncology has been revolutionized by new
        algorithms whose routine use is made possible by the exponential growth
        in computational power.  This is a story that brings together the
        influences that computing hardware, robotics, algorithms research,
        high-performance computing, and user-interface design have had on the
        process of shooting radiation at patients - and the challenges that this
        added complexity has brought for doctors and developers.

      Object-oriented design principles haven't had the effect we hoped for. The
      SOLID principles are excellent design guidelines, but experience shows
      that programmers find them difficult to follow. What do we do about this?
      Surprisingly, the Structured Design literature of forty years ago contains
      compelling solutions to many current design problems. They're simple and
      easy to understand, but were lost in the noise as OO rose to popularity.
      We'll reinterpret these simple design ideas in a modern context, finding
      that many of our most promising new design ideas resemble them. Rapid web
      application development, the area of professional programming in most dire
      need of design improvements, will serve as an example.

      working within the python ecosystem. How can these drastically different
      paradigms fit together?

      Some great things happened through a years worth of experimentation. Tests
      are fast, small, and easy(less use of mocks and other advanced testing
      tools) out of the box. What data a view or function actually needs is
      readably apparent, mocking database calls become completely unnecessary
      (due to the makeup of the new data models), other kind of data sources
      were trivial to convert; data just looked like data no matter where it
      came from(the file system, an ORM, redis, mongo).

      C is clearly the dominant language for programming embedded systems, in

    title: Pushing Websites (Google Maps) to New Heights With WebGL
    bio: >
      Google is pushing the boundaries of modern web browsers to make Google
      Maps faster, smoother, and more dynamic. WebGL is a new standard based on
      OpenGL that allows Web applications to deliver hardware-accelerated 3D
      graphics in the browser. By choosing WebGL to power Google Maps, Google
      has created an incentive for browser developers to improve WebGL support.

      John Tantalo is a Software Engineer at Google in Seattle working on Google
      Maps. He graduated from Case School of Engineering in 2007 with a BS in
      Computer Science. Before joining Google, John was an engineer at Eventful
      in San Diego. John's favorite things to do are cooking and having fun with
      his wife and two young kids.

    title: MapReduce and Google's Pregel Framework
    bio: >
      The talk starts with a brief introduction of the MapReduce system. The
      MapReduce system makes it easy to parallelize a particular form of
      computation across a large data set. It automates the process of
      splitting up and coordinating that computation and its data to run on
      thousands of machines at once. Although the implementation of
      MapReduce is complex, understanding MapReduce is actually not hard.

      Next, the Pregel project will be introduced. The objective of the
      Pregel project is to provide a unified framework for performing
      large-scale graph computations at Google that enables users to focus
      on the actual algorithm, leaving many details to the Pregel framework,
      such as distributed and multi-threaded execution, load-balancing,
      fault tolerance, data representation. This introduction explains the
      basics of defining, running, and testing a graph algorithm using
      Pregel, as well as how the system is designed.

      Shijie Zhang received her BE in Computer Science from Shanghai Jiao
      Tong University, and Ph.D. from Case Western Reserve University. Her
      research ranged from Data Mining, Graph Indexing Algorithms,
      Bioinformatics, Computer Vision, and Recommendation Systems. She has
      published a number of research papers and filed a few patents. Now
      she works at Google as a software engineer.
