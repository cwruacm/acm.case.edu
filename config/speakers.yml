    title: Pushing Websites (Google Maps) to New Heights With WebGL
    bio: >
      Google is pushing the boundaries of modern web browsers to make Google
      Maps faster, smoother, and more dynamic. WebGL is a new standard based on
      OpenGL that allows Web applications to deliver hardware-accelerated 3D
      graphics in the browser. By choosing WebGL to power Google Maps, Google
      has created an incentive for browser developers to improve WebGL support.


      John Tantalo is a Software Engineer at Google in Seattle working on Google
      Maps. He graduated from Case School of Engineering in 2007 with a BS in
      Computer Science. Before joining Google, John was an engineer at Eventful
      in San Diego. John's favorite things to do are cooking and having fun with
      his wife and two young kids.

    title: Moving the Cloud
    bio: >
      Ben is a software developer for the Windows Live Safety Platform,
      currently working with the Family Safety team. He's a very recent CWRU
      alum (Class of 2012) and is excited to be back.


      There's all sorts of information out there about how to build your cloud
      app from the ground up. But sometimes, you're not starting from scratch.
      In this talk, Ben will discuss the challenges presented when migrating an
      existing web service to a scalable cloud environment and some of the
      unexpected differences between running your own service and hosting it in
      a public data center.

    title: MapReduce and Google's Pregel Framework
    bio: >
      The talk starts with a brief introduction of the MapReduce system. The
      MapReduce system makes it easy to parallelize a particular form of
      computation across a large data set. It automates the process of
      splitting up and coordinating that computation and its data to run on
      thousands of machines at once. Although the implementation of
      MapReduce is complex, understanding MapReduce is actually not hard.


      Next, the Pregel project will be introduced. The objective of the
      Pregel project is to provide a unified framework for performing
      large-scale graph computations at Google that enables users to focus
      on the actual algorithm, leaving many details to the Pregel framework,
      such as distributed and multi-threaded execution, load-balancing,
      fault tolerance, data representation. This introduction explains the
      basics of defining, running, and testing a graph algorithm using
      Pregel, as well as how the system is designed.


      Shijie Zhang received her BE in Computer Science from Shanghai Jiao
      Tong University, and Ph.D. from Case Western Reserve University. Her
      research ranged from Data Mining, Graph Indexing Algorithms,
      Bioinformatics, Computer Vision, and Recommendation Systems. She has
      published a number of research papers and filed a few patents. Now
      she works at Google as a software engineer.
