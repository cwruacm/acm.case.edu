  You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves like it has a mind.
  Like it knows it killed the world once and got a taste for murder. After the
  avalanche, it took us a week to climb out. Now, I don't know exactly when we
  turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived the slide... and
  only five made it out.

  Now we took an oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the snow
  that killed the other two, but it wasn't. Nature is lethal but it doesn't
  hold a candle to man.

  Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That show's called a
  pilot. Then they show that show to the people who make shows, and on the
  strength of that one show they decide if they're going to make more shows.
  Some pilots get picked and become television programs. Some don't, become
  nothing.  She starred in one of the ones that became nothing.

  Your bones don't break, mine do. That's clear. Your cells react to bacteria
  and viruses differently than mine. You don't get sick, I do. That's also
  clear. But for some reason, you and I react the exact same way to water. We
  swallow it too fast, we choke. We get some in our lungs, we drown. However
  unreal it may seem, we are connected, you and I. We're on the same curve,
  just on opposite ends.
