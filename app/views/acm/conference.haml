      .title Pushing Websites (Google Maps) to New Heights With WebGL
      .bio
        %p
          Google is pushing the boundaries of modern web browsers to make Google
          Maps faster, smoother, and more dynamic. WebGL is a new standard based on
          OpenGL that allows Web applications to deliver hardware-accelerated 3D
          graphics in the browser. By choosing WebGL to power Google Maps, Google
          has created an incentive for browser developers to improve WebGL support.
        %p
          John Tantalo is a Software Engineer at Google in Seattle working on Google
          Maps. He graduated from Case School of Engineering in 2007 with a BS in
          Computer Science. Before joining Google, John was an engineer at Eventful
          in San Diego. John's favorite things to do are cooking and having fun with
          his wife and two young kids.

        Ben is a software developer for the Windows Live Safety Platform, currently working with the Family Safety team. He's a very recent CWRU alum (Class of 2012) and is excited to be back. 
        %p 
          There's all sorts of information out there about how to build your cloud app from the ground up. But sometimes, you're not starting from scratch. In this talk, Ben will discuss the challenges presented when migrating an existing web service to a scalable cloud environment and some of the unexpected differences between running your own service and hosting it in a public data center.

        Nick is a wayward electrical engineer, having spent his career in software.
        Combining expertise in both real-time, embedded systems and scalable cloud
        computing, he is a jack of all trades (perhaps a master of none).  His
        interest in continuous learning and passion for startups led him to
        LeanDog Software, where he leads Labs, focusing on assisting early stage
        tech startups.  He is also an adjunct faculty member in the Department
        of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at Case Western Reserve
        University in Cleveland, Ohio.

          management in various industries.  Joe has built and successfully managed
          an Information Security Program from the ground up for several Firms
          within industries including banking, insurance, health and legal.  Joe
          deals effectively with customers, executives, and stockholders on a
          regular basis. All of these achievements are critical to firms that must
          compete in today's difficult economy and maintain information security
          and compliance through appropriate risk management.

      .title MapReduce and Google's Pregel Framework
      .bio
        %p
          The talk starts with a brief introduction of the MapReduce system. The
          MapReduce system makes it easy to parallelize a particular form of
          computation across a large data set. It automates the process of
          splitting up and coordinating that computation and its data to run on
          thousands of machines at once. Although the implementation of
          MapReduce is complex, understanding MapReduce is actually not hard.
        %p
          Next, the Pregel project will be introduced. The objective of the
          Pregel project is to provide a unified framework for performing
          large-scale graph computations at Google that enables users to focus
          on the actual algorithm, leaving many details to the Pregel framework,
          such as distributed and multi-threaded execution, load-balancing,
          fault tolerance, data representation. This introduction explains the
          basics of defining, running, and testing a graph algorithm using
          Pregel, as well as how the system is designed.

          Shijie Zhang received her BE in Computer Science from Shanghai Jiao
          Tong University, and Ph.D. from Case Western Reserve University. Her
          research ranged from Data Mining, Graph Indexing Algorithms,
          Bioinformatics, Computer Vision, and Recommendation Systems. She has
          published a number of research papers and filed a few patents. Now
          she works at Google as a software engineer.
