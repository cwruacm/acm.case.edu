    .title Pushing Websites (Google Maps) to New Heights With WebGL
    .bio
      %p
        Google is pushing the boundaries of modern web browsers to make Google
        Maps faster, smoother, and more dynamic. WebGL is a new standard based on
        OpenGL that allows Web applications to deliver hardware-accelerated 3D
        graphics in the browser. By choosing WebGL to power Google Maps, Google
        has created an incentive for browser developers to improve WebGL support.
      %p
        John Tantalo is a Software Engineer at Google in Seattle working on Google

        Computer Science. Before joining Google, John was an engineer at Eventful
        in San Diego. John's favorite things to do are cooking and having fun with
        his wife and two young kids.
