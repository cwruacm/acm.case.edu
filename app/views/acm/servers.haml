%h2 What?
:markdown
  We all need places to play. ACM will support students by maintaining servers
  for student projects. We are currently fundraising so we may purchase two
  servers -- one for any student project and one for [ACM
  Apache](#{url_for(:acm, :index)}#apache) projects.
%h2 Why?
:markdown
  We will set up a development environment for students to work on these
  projects that is modeled after real-world software companies.  This will
  include testing, continuous integration, tickets, code review, and a managed
  push process.  This should give younger students the sort of experience that
  employers love to see in prospective candidates, before they even step foot in
  their first internship!
%h2 Who?
:markdown
  At first, upperclassmen with industry experience will recruit students to be
  involved in projects. As projects mature, leadership will be passed down to
  younger students.
%h2 How?
:markdown
  We can't do this without your support. See the instructions on the right of
  the page to find out how you can take part in this initiative.
