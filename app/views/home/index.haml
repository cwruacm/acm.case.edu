:markdown
  The Electrical Engineering and Computer Science department is a good place to shove all of the people who
  spend their days moving electrons around in some semi-organized fashion.  The students in each field
  have a few groups that join them together; they are as follows:

%a{:href => '/ieee'}
  %h2 IEEE: <small>A group for Elecrical Engineers</small>
%a{:href => '/'}
  %h2 ACM: <small>A group for Computer Scientists</small>
%a{:href => '/hacsoc'}
  %h2 HacSoc: <small>A group for those interested in pushing the boundaries of their education</small>

  These groups all work together in order to have a stronger student body overall. Check out each of their pages
  to find contact information.
