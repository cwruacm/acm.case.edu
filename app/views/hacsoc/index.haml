  HacSoc is a group associated with the CWRU ACM chapter dedicated to developing the skills needed to actually produce real world software in its members.   HacSoc hosts weekly tech talks with topics ranging from systems level security up to introducing the new features of HTML5 and even talks about the legal side of intellectual property.  Speakers have been students, professionals from industry, and occasionally professors.
